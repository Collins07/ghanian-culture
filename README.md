## Description
<p>Akan Child Naming system is an automated system that can asign names to children
depending on the day they were born and thier gender. West African communities use
the Akan names to name their children.</p>

their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were
born. Here are Ghanian day names.</p>

<p> The system allows the user to enter their date of birth by keying in their year
of birth, month and date. After the user has entered their details, they are required
to fill in their gender and agree to terms before they can get their name prompted
by the system.</p>
